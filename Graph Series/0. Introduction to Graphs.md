Graph is a data structure having two components, a node/vertex and an edge which connect two vertices.  
Pairs of nodes connected by edges is a graph.

### Types of Graphs

1. Undirected Graph - Edges do not have any direction. If there is an edge between u and v then there  
   is also an edge between v and u.
   
2. Directed Graph - If the edge u and v is directed(u -> v), then we can only go from u to v  
   but not from v to u.

### Degree

Degree(V) = Degree of vertex V is no of edges connecting to it.

Degree(0) = 3  
Degree(1) = 2  
Degree(2) = 2  
Degree(3) = 1  

#### Property:
Total Degree of all the nodes = 2 * Edges  
This is the property for undirected graph.

### Indegree/Outdegree

In a directed graph,  
Indegree(V) = Number of edges which are coming into V  
Outdegree(V) = Number of edges going out from V

Indegree(2) = 2  
Outdegree(2) = 1

### Path

In graph, path is sequence of nodes such that none of the nodes are visited twice in the path.


### Others

We have cyclic graphs, i.e. graphs that can contain a cycle. And therefore we can have:  
1. Undirected cyclic graph: An undirected graph containing a cycle.
2. Undirected acycic graph: An undirected graph without cycle.
3. Directed cyclic graph: A directed graph with cycle. 
4. Directed acyclic graph: A directed graph without cycle.

**Weighted graphs:**  
Weighted graphs are those graphs in which edges are assigned numerical weights.
If weights are not given and we have to consider the weights, then consider weights of unit weight.
